# Repetition #2

## Repetition structures
* Condition-controlled loops
* Count-controlled loops
* Nested loops
 </br> </br>

## Keywords
* Iterable: contains a sequence of values that can be iterated over </br>
* Sentinel: special value that marks the end of a sequence of items </br>
* Input validation: inspecting input before it is processed by the program </br>
* Nested loop: loop that is contained inside another loop </br> </br>

## Key points about nested loops: </br>
- Inner loop goes through all of its iterations for each iteration of outer loop </br>
- Inner loops complete their iterations faster than outer loops </br>
- Total number of iterations in nested loop:   	 </br>
  - number_iterations_inner  x  </br> 
  - number_iterations_outer </br>
